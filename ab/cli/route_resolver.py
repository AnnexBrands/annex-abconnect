"""Route-to-method resolver via source-code introspection.

Maps each public method of an endpoint class to its Route constant by
parsing the method's source code for ``self._request(_ROUTE_NAME`` calls,
then matching against module-level Route instances.

Known limitations
-----------------
- Methods that call ``self._client.request()`` directly (bypassing
  ``_request()``) will NOT be matched.  Known cases: ``get_timeline_agent``
  in JobsEndpoint, ``upload``/``get`` in DocumentsEndpoint.
- Methods that delegate through a private helper (e.g. ``self._pdf()`` in
  FormsEndpoint) will NOT be matched unless the helper is added to the
  regex alternation below.
- Wrapper methods that call another public method instead of ``_request``
  (e.g. ``get_timeline`` → ``get_timeline_response``) will NOT be matched.

These unmatched methods are shown as "Helpers (no API route)" in CLI
listings — a graceful degradation, not an error.
