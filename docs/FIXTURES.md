# Fixture Tracking

Tracks capture status and quality gates for all endpoint fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`.

**Constitution**: v2.3.0, Principles I–V
**Quality Gates**: G1 (Model Fidelity), G2 (Fixture Status), G3 (Test Quality), G4 (Doc Accuracy), G5 (Param Routing), G6 (Request Quality)
**Rule**: Status is "complete" only when ALL applicable gates pass.

## Summary

- **Total endpoints**: 231
- **Complete (all gates pass)**: 38
- **G1 Model Fidelity**: 71/231 pass
- **G2 Fixture Status**: 75/231 pass
- **G3 Test Quality**: 139/231 pass
- **G4 Doc Accuracy**: 157/231 pass
- **G5 Param Routing**: 216/231 pass
- **G6 Request Quality**: 223/231 pass

## Status Legend

- **complete**: All applicable quality gates pass
- **incomplete**: One or more gates fail
- **PASS/FAIL**: Per-gate status
