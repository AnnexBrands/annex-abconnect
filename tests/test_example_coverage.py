"""Coverage gate: every routed endpoint has a canonical example (feature 037).

Non-live. Sources the precise endpoint->example map from
``ab.progress.example_index`` (canonical = a non-underscore plain script that calls
the endpoint, resolving to a real Route).

The two ``STRICT_*`` flags below are the explicit hardening points:
- ``STRICT_COVERAGE`` is flipped to True (T013) once every routed endpoint has a
  canonical example; until then a remaining gap is reported as ``xfail`` so the
  in-progress feature does not turn the suite red.
- ``STRICT_NO_LEGACY`` is flipped to True (T031) once the deprecated-runner
  migration is complete.
