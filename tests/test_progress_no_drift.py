"""No-drift guard for the progress report.

The progress report (``html/progress.html``) is generated entirely from live
introspection — the route set, the on-disk fixtures, and the test constants —
rather than from hand-maintained markdown that silently rots. These tests pin
that contract: each one would have failed against the bugs that motivated the
rewrite, so a regression that reintroduces drift turns the build red.
